                    Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian
                    international cricketer and former captain of the Indian national team who plays as a right-handed
                    batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely
                    regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[3] Kohli holds the record for scoring most runs
                    in both T20 internationals and in IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him as the
                    male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the
                    2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.
